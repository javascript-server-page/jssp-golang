# jssp
JavaScript Server Pages:four_leaf_clover::tulip::rose::hibiscus:

- v1.0 branch js engine using [robertkrimen/otto](https://github.com/robertkrimen/otto)
- v2.0 branch js engine using [dop251/goja](https://github.com/dop251/goja) , and on the basis of v1.0 improved a lot of features, including ts, engine cache, ast cache, project refactoring, etc.
- However, due to the weak performance of the js engine implemented in golang, and until there is a better binding library between golang and v8, this project will not be updated or accept pr.
- At the same time, it was discovered that the binary generated by pkg packaging of nodejs can also do what was envisioned in this project,
- so finally decided to use nodejs to implement jssp [jssp-nodejs](https://github.com/javascript-server-page/jssp-nodejs)
